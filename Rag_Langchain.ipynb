PDF Annotations: Provide tools to write, draw, and highlight directly on PDFs, enhancing collaboration and docu ment review processes. 3.

The focus is on tools that handle Arabic, French, and English languages, catering to both B2B and B2C markets. The key features evaluated include layout preservation, Arabic support and quality, translation accuracy and speed, pricing model, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) support. To assess these tools, a series of test cases were conducted for each language, including: 1. Text -based documents: Evaluating basic translation accuracy, layout preservation, handling of number lists, bullet points, and right -to-left (RTL) and left -to-right (LTR) conversions. 2. Scanned documents: Testing OCR performance, particularly for Arabic, and preservation of bullet points, number lists, and order. 3.

Text -based documents: Evaluating basic translation accuracy, layout preservation, handling of number lists, bullet points, and right -to-left (RTL) and left -to-right (LTR) conversions. 2. Scanned documents: Testing OCR performance, particularly for Arabic, and preservation of bullet points, number lists, and order. 3. Tables (as text): Checking if tables remain aligned and readable, with attention to merged cells and number formatting. 4. Tables (as images): Evaluating the same as above with the addition of OCR. 5. Scanned documents with stamps or signatures: Testing performance with logos and non - translatable elements'),\n",
